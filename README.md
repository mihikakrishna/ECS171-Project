# Hand Gesture Recognition (22)
### Hi Grader ðŸ‘‹ 
<b>Fun Fact:</b> We were the <b>only</b> group out of 36 groups to have a live VISUAL demo on presentation day ðŸ¤¯ and it worked seemlessly well. 

## About The Project
![](https://github.com/mihikakrishna/ECS171-Project/blob/main/demo/live_demo.gif)

Our ECS171 project is a joint effort by a team of five passionate individuals aiming to understand how humans interact with computers. We built a hand gesture recognition system that we implemented on a website. By combining our knowledge of deep learning techniques and computer vision algorithms, our objective was to create a system capable of accurately recognizing and categorizing various hand gestures in real-time scenarios. Through careful testing and continuous refinement, we assessed the performance of our hand gesture recognition system using a diverse range of hand gestures. The outcomes we obtained illustrate the exciting possibilities of improving human-computer interaction through intuitive and effortless control using gestures in different applications.
